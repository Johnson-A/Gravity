# Gravity

This is an N-body simulation I wrote several years ago. A Barnes-Hut algorithm is used to calculate the simulation and display the mass density in space. The simulation is almost fully multi-threaded.

# TODO

* Rewrite in Rust?
* Understand error incorporated by Barnes-Hut
* Use Runge-Kutta instead of forward time
* Better visualization
* 3D implementation and visualization
